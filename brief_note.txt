This code is used for screening clinical and non-clinical cases.

use logistic regression to predict clinical cases.
create a screener test-only contains less amount of items.

examle:
total-300 items
screener-50 items

regardless what types of item response type, logistic regression can accomplish this goal-screening clinical 
and nonclinical cases.

psychometrical speaking-using less subtest items will result in less cost, easier administration, and 
less possible distractions from multidimensionality, random bias. 

power of test to differentiate clinical and nonclinical cases.

sensitivity-how accurate to identify clinical case (type I error).

specificity- how accurate to identify non-clinical case (type II error)

* sensitivity and specificity must be both above 80% (celf-5 requirement)

example: 84 cases (42 clinical/non-clinical cases)

|reality |  c      | N    |
-----------------------------
|c       |   X(33) | Y(9) |
-----------------------------
|n       |   W(9)  | Z(33) |

Positive predictive power= X*base rate /(X * base rate + (1-base rate)*Y)(33/42)
Negative decision power= Z*(1-base rate) /(W*base rate + Z*(1-base rate))(33/42)

The base rate here is 50% (42 clinical cases: 42 non-clinical cases)

ROC curve (based on cut-off line)

the more ROC curve above diagonal line, the better and more useful this ROC curve is


1.Whether the LR model is significant?
2. Wald CHI-SQUARE and P-value check (e.g., gender, treatment)
3. check "Percent Concordant" value (e.g., the higher the better, at least 80% baseline)

cut score must be selected by each age group.
